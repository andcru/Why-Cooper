In recent years. multi-core processor\nhas become the norm. The goal of the vapor compressor\ncooling system is to allow a chip to be over-clocked in order\nto increase clock speed to get better performance. These\nover-clocked chips have the ability to conduct intensive\ncalculations and can be used for simulations. cancer\nresearch, DNA folding, etc. An Intel quad-core chip was\nused with factory settings at 2.4 GHz and was increased to\na steady 4.1 GHz clock speed. With increased demand on\nthe chip. the cooling needs increased greatly and needed\napproximately a 250 Watt cooling capacity. Another issue is\nchip longevity; colder temperatures increase the life of a\nchip and would allow over-clocking a viable option. The vapor\ncompression system allowed for 250 Watt of heat removal\nwhile keeping the chip at temperatures below -20 degrees Celsius.</p>\n<p>Advisor: <a href=\"http://engfac.cooper.edu/sidebo\">George Sidebotham</a></p>", "title": "Vapor Compression Computer Cooling System", "tags": ["mechanical engineering", "senior project", "thermodynamics", "cpu cooling"], "created": "2012-11-24 16:42:41.230464+00:00", "members": [{"contact": "", "id": 72, "name": "Xiaoyu Chi"}, {"contact": "", "id": 73, "name": "Andrew Hsu"}], "images": [{"image": "https://cuproj.s3.amazonaws.com/images/VaporCompression-17.jpg", "id": 68}], "id": 42}, {"description": "<p>The objective of the class was to design and build a drill capable of drilling through granite. This drill consists of a tripod body connected to a descending gearbox platform with the use of a hydraulic cylinder. The hydraulic cylinder provides roughly the 1000psi needed to accomplish the task. The gear box includes a 2 HP AC motor which drives a vertical rotating shaft, which makes contact with the granite. and the pump which provides hydraulic fluid from the reservoir to the cylinder. As the gearbox platform moves down, the pressure of the rotating shaft grinds through the rock. The gearbox features a clutch in order to control the cylinder without rotating the shaft. spur gears. and bevel gears. Controlling the thrust of the bevel gears was the biggest challenge. The gearbox platform is held in place using three aluminum stability rods that run vertical within the body.</p>\n<p>We would like to thank Prof. Reilly, Michael Schaff.

With a specific budget, a drill was designed in SolidWorks that could provide enough torque and downward force to drill through a slab of granite. Our drill design consisted of a steal frame made of L-brackets and stainless stell rods joined in a rigid fashion. A gear box was designed to gear down a pre-purchased motor to achieve the correct torque for drilling through the granite. The gear box consists of four heavy duty gears with various thrust and ball bearings to counteract the forces experienced during drilling. Rollers were attached on the sides of the gear box and were meant to roll up and down the L-brackets during lifting and drilling. The rollers would counteract the opposing twisting of the gear box by transferring it to the rigid frame. The motor was then attached on top of the gear box and this entire assembly moves up and down with the drill bit. On top, two hydraulic pistons provide downward force to the entire system.</p>\n<p>Acquisition of components was an integral part of the design process. Combined with the strict deadlines set forth by the class. the project components needed to be purchased not only quickly. but within budget.</p>\n<p>A final stage of the project was a failure analysis. Following the testing of the prototype.\nstudents were required to analyze the failure mode of the drill. In the current drill design, it was\ndetermined that the loads being applied through the gear box had caused a thrust bearing to fall\nprematurely. Additionally, parts of the gear box started to buckle under these loads causing\nunforeseen forces to be applied. Finally, the shocks experienced by the drill caused chaotic motion of the gearbox that needed to be rectified during testing.</p>", "title": "Tower Drill", "tags": ["mechanical engineering", "solidworks", "eoys2011", "mechanical design", "geothermal drill"], "created": "2012-11-24 16:36:59.381597+00:00", "members": [{"contact": "", "id": 47, "name": "Helen Minsky"}, {"contact": "", "id": 68, "name": "Lili Ehrlich"}, {"contact": "", "id": 69, "name": "William Witter"}, {"contact": "", "id": 70, "name": "Raymond Bekhee"}], "images": [{"image": "https://cuproj.s3.amazonaws.com/images/TowerDrill-4.jpg", "id": 66}], "id": 40}, {"description": "<p>The talking flower wall is a sound-to-light installation designed for\nthe Interactive Light Studio at PS. 347.
