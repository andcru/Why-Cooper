<h1>WHY A FREE COOPER UNION IS WORTH SAVING</h1>

<p>The Cooper Union was founded by Peter Cooper (philanthropist, inventor, and visionary) on the principle that education should be "free as air and water". The school has been able to offer a full tuition scholarship for all incoming students since 1902. This policy changed on Tuesday, April 23rd, 2013 at 12:17 pm, when the Board of Trustees announced the end of the full tuition policy.</p>

<p>The success of the school is deeply rooted in the principle of free access to education for all. It's something that shapes us and allows us to be everything we can be. We believe that a free Cooper is worth saving, and here is why:</p>

<b><i>Merit-based equality</i></b>
<p>A full tuition scholarship is the only undeniably need-blind acceptance policy. Cooper Union provides opportunity for all students, including those who cannot afford the price tag associated with higher education yet also cannot reap the benefits of financial aid. The school brings together and develops the talent that would otherwise go unnoticed. It is one of the few remaining schools that can say: "It does not matter to us where you come from or who your parents are. Here is an exceptional education: come and get it."</p>

<b><i>A commitment to education</i></b>
<p>Cooper focuses solely on education. We have no gym, no swimming pool, and no meal plan. The full tuition scholarship pays for a superb and focused academic experience, and students use this gift to learn as much as possible, taking anywhere from 6-10 classes a semester. Our professors appreciate our immense desire to learn, and are willing to invest incredible amounts of effort in helping us reach our greatest potentials. They expect us to accomplish the impossible and push us until we rise to the occasion.</p>

<b><i>A culture of collaboration</i></b>
<p>Without socioeconomic barriers, Cooper students maintain incredible respect for one another, fostering a uniquely collaborative and mutually-encouraging environment. Destructive competition does not exist here. Getting ahead does not equate to knocking someone else down. In fact, students willingly drop their projects and forego studying for tests to spend hours helping a peer with his or her problems. We build off of each other's knowledge to produce results that no one student could accomplish alone.</p>

<b><i>The freedom of unburdened curiosity</i></b>
<p>Unburdened by student debt, Cooper students are free to pursue careers that inspire us, regardless of what they pay. A free education, however, allows for more than just that. The rising cost of higher education often forces students to think of college as an investment that must produce financial returns, rather than as an opportunity to explore their intellectual interests. Unrestricted by the ties of financial obligation, Cooper students are free to seek academic challenges, pursue their creative interests, and take risks that they may not have otherwise been able to take.</p>

<p>Cooper Union's full scholarship has offered over a hundred fifty years of students the truest form of meritocracy. We believe this incredible opportunity is absolutely worth saving, for future scholars, for New York City, and for the global community. </p>
