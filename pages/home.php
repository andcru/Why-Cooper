		<h1>Check out the story of Cooper Union - told by its students</h1>
		<p>The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, commonly referred to simply as Cooper Union, is a privately funded college in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, located at Cooper Square and Astor Place. Founded in 1859, and inspired in 1830 when Peter Cooper learned about the government-supported École Polytechnique of Paris,[4][5] the school established a radical new model of American higher education: its mission reflects founder Peter Cooper's fundamental belief that an education "equal to the best"[6] should be accessible to those who qualify, independent of their race, religion, sex, wealth or social status, and should be "open and free to all".[7] The Cooper Union previously granted each admitted student a full-tuition scholarship; as of April 23, 2013, due to financial concerns, that policy has been eliminated. [8]</p>
		<p>The college is divided into three schools: the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture, the School of Art, and the Albert Nerken School of Engineering. It offers undergraduate and Master's degree programs exclusively in the fields of architecture, fine arts, and engineering. It is a member of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) and the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD). Cooper is considered to be one of the most prestigious colleges in the United States, with all three of its member schools consistently ranked among the highest in the country.[9] Dr. Jamshed Bharucha has succeeded George Campbell Jr. as the college’s twelfth president.</p>
